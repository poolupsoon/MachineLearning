## Predicting the Class of Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl

In this project, I will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways:

- **Class A**: exactly according to the specification
- **Class B**: throwing the elbows to the front
- **Class C**: lifting the dumbbell only halfway
- **Class D**: lowering the dumbbell only halfway
- **Class E**: throwing the hips to the front

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training data set. The data for this project comes from this source: [http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)
